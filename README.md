# calculator-in-c

This project is a simple command-line calculator written in C language.
<br>
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations — Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division — through an easy-to-use menu-driven interface.
<br>
The calculator demonstrates the use of loops, switch-case statements, and conditional handling in C programming.
<br>

⚙️ Features
1.Addition<br>
2.Subtraction<br>
3.Multiplication<br>
4.Division (with zero-division check)<br>

 ADDING ON:-
1.) Continuous operation until the user exits.<br>
2.) Written in pure C with standard libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h).<br>

Technologies Used:-
Language: C<br>
Compiler: GCC / MinGW<br>



🧩 Example Output<br>
=== Simple Calculator ===
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Exit


💡 Future Enhancements
1.)Add support for modulus and power operations.<br>
2.)Include floating-point precision settings.<br>
3.)Build a GUI version using C++ or Python.<br>
