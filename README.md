# calculator-in-c

This project is a simple command-line calculator written in C language.
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations — Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division — through an easy-to-use menu-driven interface.
The calculator demonstrates the use of loops, switch-case statements, and conditional handling in C programming.

⚙️ Features
1.Addition
2.Subtraction
3.Multiplication
4.Division (with zero-division check)

 ADDING ON:-
1.) Continuous operation until the user exits
2.) Written in pure C with standard libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h)

Technologies Used:-
Language: C
Compiler: GCC / MinGW



🧩 Example Output
=== Simple Calculator ===
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15.00


💡 Future Enhancements
1.)Add support for modulus and power operations.
2.)Include floating-point precision settings.
3.)Build a GUI version using C++ or Python.
